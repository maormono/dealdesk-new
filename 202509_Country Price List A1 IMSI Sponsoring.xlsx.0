General notes:,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,
The rates supercede all previously communicated rates by Telecom Liechtenstein AG,,,,,,,,,,,
"The rates can change as a result of currency fluctuations, value-added tax, or changes in the IOT settlement by third parties or a change in discounts.",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,
Currently we are able to pass on the EU regulated rates.,,,,,,,,,,,
"Due to the fact that ""Roam like at home"" does not apply to IoT devices - this could be charged differently in the future.",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,
All rates are exclusive of any local taxes.,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,
Any traffic roam in a network without a rate indication in the current price list will be charged a rate of  EUR 20.00 / MB / SMS / MIN,,,,,,,,,,,
"The listed rates exclude Satellite, Maritime, Premium, Video Telephony and special numbers, which will be rated according to AA14.",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,
We kindly ask you to reconfirm acceptance of the new sell rates by return e-mail.,,,,,,,,,,,
"Should we not receive any reply within 72 hours after receipt, we assume the attached pricing to be accepted by you.",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,
Thank you for your understanding and please feel free to contact your Account Manager for further information.,,,,,,,,,,,
