,Permanent Roaming,Brazil,all,all,all,"Prohibition on M2M Permanent Roaming 
– ANATEL prohibits M2M permanent roaming. 
– ANATEL posited that local wireless carriers should prevent M2M permanent roaming (foreign based carriers using foreign numbering SIMS) over their respective networks.
– ANATEL has taken a view that it considers the use by foreign carriers of foreign SIMS for M2M services as a value added service that should only be provided by local carriers (licensed) with local SIMS. 
– Most leading industrialized nations have taken a more permissive approach to permanent roaming, recognizing that it can enable local IoT providers to grow their businesses by competing in new international markets while also increasing IoT choices for local consumers. 
– There is also a local tax law (FISTEL) that applies to local carriers who have local SIMS (which under permanent roaming we do not have any and are not subject to this law) and thus certain carriers have complained about the disadvantage local carriers face if they were to do M2M. 
– ANATEL included the issue in its agenda review with the impact analysis due second semester 2018.
